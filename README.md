Project - Getting and Cleaning Data Course
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set to make it tidy. The tidy data set will then be used for exploratory and advanced analytics. Data for this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
There are following files in this repo:
1.    run_analysis.R
2.    CodeBook.md

##run_analysis.R
This file includes all the required codes to create directory, manipulate to make a tidy data set for exploratory and directed analytical queries. The major goals of this project is as follows, that include creation of merged and independent tidy data sets saved to the working directory.
•    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
•	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
•	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
•	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
•	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
